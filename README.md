# The Oslo Hotel Website
## Mileston Project 1

The aim of this project is to create a static front end site of at least 3 pages or sections using HTML and Css and optional bootstrap or other libraries. The aim of the site is to present useful information in an ordered way to a set of users.
I have decided to created a website for a fictional hotel. I have utilized all the elements I have learned in the previous moduals to create this page and used principals of good user experience to create a responsive, well designed functional website.
