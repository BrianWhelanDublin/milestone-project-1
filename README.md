# The Oslo Hotel Website
## Mileston Project 1

The aim of this project is to create a static front end site of at least 3 pages or sections using the technologies I have learned so far such as, HTML, Css, and optional Bootstrap or other libraries. The aim of the site is to present useful information in an ordered way to a set of users.
I have decided to created a website for a fictional hotel. I have utilized all the elements I have learned in the previous moduals to create this page and used principals of good user experience to create a responsive, well designed functional website.
My site consists of a landing page to introduce the hotel and the section pages. The site then has 3 pages, one for the hotel guestrooms, one for the hotel food and bar options, and the final for the spa and leisure options. There is also a booking form section for potention guest to fill out to book rooms.
